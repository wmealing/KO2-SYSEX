# KO2-SYSEX

I have started reverse engineering TE's sysex protocol.


## My email:

Gday,

I'm interested in getting information on the KO II midi sysex protocol for listing updating samples and firwmare. I am aware of the current website tools and would like to develop my own, I am not expecting support from Teenage Engineering on developing the tools.

I have started reverse engineering the process ( see https://github.com/wmealing/KO2-SYSEX/blob/main/SAMPLE-TOOL-START.md ) and would like to create command line tools (of my own, not to be supported by Teeenage Engineering).

Is there any way that I can get details on the sysex protocol ? I thought I should ask before I spend many, many hours on this.

Thanks in advance.

Wade Mealing

hi Wade,
 
thank you for contacting us!
 
even if we encourage your exploration and research, unfortunately, we can't share any details related to the sysex protocol used.
 
good luck with your project, and don't hesitate to contact us if you have any further questions! meanwhile, have a nice day.


kindly,
teenage engineering support



## So what next ?


I continue on my path, without TE assistance.  However this is unsurprising as many companies mistakenly believe
that this is where their value lies.   This simply means that I'll get i done without their help.

However, I could see use your help !

If you can correct what I have done, or have work of your own I strongly encourage you to participate.
